# Deployment-Strategies-of-Cloud
## Introduction
First let us understand what Cloud is and what cloud computing is then we will come to the issue of deployment strategies of cloud. Cloud is the computing resources which are provided to us like storage, RAM, CPU, networking etc. over the internet.
While cloud computing is using these on demand resources over the internet  for deploying applications or any other task without hardware being physically present with us. This ensures accesibility, scalability, observability, reliability, authenticity, security etc.
Here we will be talking about two types of cloud:
 ### 1. Public Cloud: 
This is a cloud computing model where computing resources like servers, storage, and applications are owned and operated by third-party cloud providers like AWS, GCC(google cloud), Microsoft Azure and are shared among multiple users over the internet.
- This means that a single computing resource can be shared with many users at a particular time which is sometimes undesirable. Nowadays many companies and organisations are using public cloud to host their applications like Netflix, Gmail, Dropbox etc.
Some Advantages of Public Cloud are:
- High Scalability – Instantly increase or decrease resources according to need.
- Reliability – Cloud providers like AWS offer high uptime (99.99%) and they have a contract for the same.
- Global Reach – We can access resources from anywhere using just an internet connection and logging in to cloud providers site.
- Low Cost – We dont have to pay for hardware set up like servers and computing resources like CPU, RAM, Storage etc. as the cloud provider does it for us. 
### 2. Private Cloud:
 This is a cloud computing model where resources are exclusively used by a single organization. It provides greater control, security, and customization, making it ideal for businesses with strict data security and compliance requirements. Examples include Openstack, VMware.
The single organisation hosting the private cloud has full control over it and its hardware resources which gives it <ins> TCO or total cost of ownership over its product </ins>
- Private Cloud is better over public cloud if you want full control over your resources and dont have much budget constraint as it gives TCO as said above while public cloud provides lower set up costs but can have unpredictable costs over time which are undesirable.
Advantages:
- TCO – The company has full control over their resources and hardware which is an ideal situation instead of 3rd party controlling it
- High security – Company has full access and ownership over resources so automatically the security also increases
- Increased Performance – There is no resource sharing with other users so performance is increased.
